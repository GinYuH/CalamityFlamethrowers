[h1]Calamity Flamethrowers[/h1]
Adds a flamethrower for almost every Calamity boss that doesn't have one. Note: May not be completely balanced yet

All flamethrowers have a 25% drop rate in Normal Mode and 33% in Expert Mode (except the sentinels which have a third of both due to sharing the same weapon)
